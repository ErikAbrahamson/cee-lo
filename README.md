## Cee-Lo
### A Dice Rolling Game
___
Cee-lo is a gambling game played with three six-sided dice. There is no one standard set of rules. In America it is also called “See-Low,” “Four-Five-Six,” “The Three Dice Game,” “Chinchirorin,” and by several alternative spellings, as well as simply “Dice.”  

Three dice are required for this game.  

In non-banking games, each player has essentially equal status, and rules must exist for the players to pool their bets and attempt to win from a common pot.  There is also a banking version that is not described here.  

Non-Banking Rules  

In this version of the game, each round involves two or more players of equal status. A bet amount is agreed upon and each player puts that amount in the pile or pot. Each player then has to roll all three dice at once and must continue until a recognized combination is rolled. Whichever player rolls the best combination wins the entire pot, and a new round begins. In cases where two or more players tie for the best combination, they must have a shoot out to determine a single winner.  

***The combinations and can be ranked from best to worst as:***  

>4-5-6
The highest possible roll. If you roll 4-5-6, you automatically win.
“Trips”
Rolling three of the same number is known as rolling “trips”. Higher trips beat lower trips, so 4-4-4 is better than 3-3-3.
“Point”
Rolling a pair, and another number, establishes the singleton as a “point”. A higher point beats a lower point, so 1-1-3 is better than 6-6-2.
1-2-3
The lowest possible roll. If you roll 1-2-3, you automatically lose.
Any other roll is a meaningless combination and must be rerolled until one of the above combinations occurs.
